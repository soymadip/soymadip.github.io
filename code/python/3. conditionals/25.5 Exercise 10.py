# Loan Eligibility Checker
# You’re building a basic loan eligibility checker for a bank. A customer must meet two conditions to be eligible:

# Tasks:

#     If the user’s age is 21 or above, check:

#         If income is 25,000 Bucks or above, return: "Eligible for loan"

#         Otherwise, return: "Not eligible: Income too low"

#     If the user’s age is less than 21, return: "Not eligible: Age must be 21 or above"


# This function will be tested by the evaluation system. Do not modify the function name or parameters.
