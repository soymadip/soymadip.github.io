## 📤 Deployment

> [!WARNING]
> **Beta Notice:**  
> Portosaurus is currently in its beta phase.  
> Expect frequent updates and breaking changes.   

There are several ways get Portosaurus up and running.


### 1. GitHub Pages

GitHub provides free hosting service for static sites like these in [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).  

Here are the steps:

1. Use the `use this template` button at top right corner & choose `Create a new repository` option.
2. In the following page, name the new repository `<your_username>.github.io` (like for me `soymadip.github.io`).
3. In the newly created repository, Go to `settings` > `Pages` > `Build and deployment` > `Source` & select `GitHub Actions` from the dropdown.
4. Now edit the [`config.js`](./config.js) with appropriate details.

The site should be up and running after a few minutes.


### 2. Manual building

Also you can compile the source code & manually upload/host with your preferred hosting service.

In your terminal, paste these commands:-

```bash
bash .github/compile.sh
```
This will compile the site and put them in `build` dir.
